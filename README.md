# The HTTP Connection.
A simple HTTP Connection is a project that demonstrates how Python works with the HyperText Transfer Protocol. The connections are both in HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and their URLs

The project connects the HTTP server and client. 
 * HTTP Client
 > As it is seen in the program, the HTTP server uses [URL's opener](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request). The parsing provides a way to interact with the resources identified by such a URL. The function urlOpen() opens a URL string as an input... 
 * HTTP Server
 > When the URL opens, the HTTP server grabs the contents of the scraped [server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html#module-socketserver) and returns a file-like object representing such a response as an output.    
# Library Used: 
 * Import Error
 > Import error: library is a Python mechanism to handle exceptions and errors. The created objects may represent errors that occur as the program runs or executes. There should be a mechanism to handle that as part of Python's built-in functionalities. In [MlengelaHttpConnection]() 
 * Import Sys
 * Import http.client
# Features:
 * Function creation with arguments such as address, port, and resources for connection creation
 * Error handling with try, except, and finally as the program is making requests
 * The project makes a simple user interface to show an HTTP connection to the user. 
# Usage: 
# Contributions: 
I welcome contributions to the program! Who knows? It might not run on the user's end. If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or any kind of feature requests, to contact me or submit a pull request.
