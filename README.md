# The Understanding of the HTTP Connection in Python
A simple HTTP Connection is a project that demonstrates how Python works with the HyperText Transfer Protocol. The connections are both in HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and their URLs

The project connects the HTTP server and client. 
 * HTTP Client
 > As it is seen in the program, the HTTP server uses [URL's opener](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request). The parsing provides a way to interact with the resources identified by such a URL. The function urlOpen() opens a URL string as an input... 
 * HTTP Server
 > When the URL opens, the HTTP server grabs the contents of the scraped [server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html#module-socketserver) and returns a file-like object representing such a response as an output.    
# GET & POST Methods: 
 * GET Method
 > 
 * POST Method
